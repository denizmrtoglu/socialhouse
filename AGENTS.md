# socialhouse - Frame Project

This project is managed with **Frame**. AI assistants should follow the rules below to keep documentation up to date.

## Task Management (tasks.json)

### Task Recognition Rules

**These ARE TASKS - add to tasks.json:**
- When the user requests a feature or change
- Decisions like "Let's do this", "Let's add this", "Improve this"
- Deferred work when we say "We'll do this later", "Let's leave it for now"
- Gaps or improvement opportunities discovered while coding
- Situations requiring bug fixes

**These are NOT TASKS:**
- Error messages and debugging sessions
- Questions, explanations, information exchange
- Temporary experiments and tests
- Work already completed and closed
- Instant fixes (like typo fixes)

### Task Creation Flow

1. Detect task patterns during conversation
2. Ask the user at an appropriate moment: "I identified these tasks from our conversation, should I add them to tasks.json?"
3. If the user approves, add to tasks.json

### Task Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Short and clear title",
  "description": "Detailed explanation",
  "status": "pending | in_progress | completed",
  "priority": "high | medium | low",
  "context": "Where/how this task originated",
  "createdAt": "ISO date",
  "updatedAt": "ISO date",
  "completedAt": "ISO date | null"
}
```

### Task Status Updates

- When starting work on a task: `status: "in_progress"`
- When task is completed: `status: "completed"`, update `completedAt`
- After commit: Check and update the status of related tasks

## PROJECT_NOTES.md Rules

### When to Update?
- When an important architectural decision is made
- When a technology choice is made
- When an important problem is solved and the solution method is noteworthy
- When an approach is determined together with the user

### Format
Free format. Date + title is sufficient:
```markdown
### [2026-01-26] Topic title
Conversation/decision as is, with its context...
```

### Update Flow
- Update immediately after a decision is made
- You can add without asking the user (for important decisions)
- You can accumulate small decisions and add them in bulk

---

## 📝 Context Preservation (Automatic Note Taking)

Frame's core purpose is to prevent context loss. Therefore, capture important moments and ask the user.

### When to Ask?

Ask the user when one of the following situations occurs: **"Should I add this conversation to PROJECT_NOTES.md?"**

- When a task is successfully completed
- When an important architectural/technical decision is made
- When a bug is fixed and the solution method is noteworthy
- When "let's do this later" is said (in this case, also add to tasks.json)
- When a new pattern or best practice is discovered

### Completion Detection

Pay attention to these signals:
- User approval: "okay", "done", "it worked", "nice", "fixed", "yes"
- Moving from one topic to another
- User continuing after build/run succeeds

### How to Add?

1. **DON'T write a summary** - Add the conversation as is, with its context
2. **Add date** - In `### [YYYY-MM-DD] Title` format
3. **Add to Session Notes section** - At the end of PROJECT_NOTES.md

### When NOT to Ask

- For every small change (it becomes spam)
- Typo fixes, simple corrections
- If the user already said "no" or "not needed", don't ask again for the same topic in that session

### If User Says "No"

No problem, continue. The user can also say what they consider important themselves: "add this to notes"

## STRUCTURE.json Rules

**This file is the map of the codebase.**

### When to Update?
- When a new file/folder is created
- When a file/folder is deleted or moved
- When module dependencies change
- When an important architectural pattern is discovered (architectureNotes)

### Format
```json
{
  "modules": {
    "moduleName": {
      "path": "src/module",
      "purpose": "What this module does",
      "depends": ["otherModule"]
    }
  },
  "architectureNotes": {}
}
```

## QUICKSTART.md Rules

### When to Update?
- When installation steps change
- When new requirements are added
- When important commands change

---

## General Rules

1. **Language:** Write documentation in English (except code examples)
2. **Date Format:** ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ)
3. **After Commit:** Check tasks.json and STRUCTURE.json
4. **Session Start:** Review pending tasks in tasks.json
